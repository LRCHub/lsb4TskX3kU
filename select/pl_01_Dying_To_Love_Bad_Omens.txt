Driving home with nowhere to be
Passing ghosts that tire of sleep
Blurry faces staring at me
They're staring but
they don't see a thing
Well, I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
One more second's enough
Second to love
Second to love
I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
One more second's enough
Second to love
Second to love
Stepping stones that
bloody your feet
Sirens holding
flowers of teeth
They call your name
from ivory streets
But heaven isn't
quite what it seems
I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
One more second's enough
Second to love
Second to love
I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
One more second's enough
Second to love
Second to love
They circle over the stain
My essence slipping away
Waiting their turn for a
Taste
Taste
So tell me how does it taste?
And was it all worth the wait?
So was it worth what it takes?
I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
One more second's enough
Second to love
Second to love
I've been dying to love
Dying to love
Dying to love
One more second's enough
Second to love
Second to love
