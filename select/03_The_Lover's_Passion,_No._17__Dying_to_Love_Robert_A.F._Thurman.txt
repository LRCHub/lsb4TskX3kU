Die! Die!
Die in this love!
If you die in this love
Your soul will be renewed
Die! Die!
Don't fear the death
Of that which is known if you die to the temporal
You will become timeless
Die! Die!
Cutt off those chains that hold you prisoner to the world of attachment
Die! Die!
Die to the deathless
And you will be eternal
Die! Die!
And come out of this cloud
When you leave the cloud you will be the effulgent moon
Die! Die!
Die to the din and the noise of mundane concerns
In the silence of love you will find the spark of life
