"Dying To Love"

Driving home with nowhere to be
Passing ghosts that tire of sleep
Blurry faces staring at me
They're staring, but they don't see a thing

Well, I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love
One more second's enough, second to love, second to love
I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love
One more second's enough, second to love, second to love

Stepping stones that bloody your feet
Sirens holding flowers of teeth
They call your name from ivory streets
But heaven isn't quite what it seems

I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love
One more second's enough, second to love, second to love
I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love
One more second's enough, second to love, second to love

They circle over the stain
My essence slipping away
Waiting their turn for a taste
Taste
So tell me, how does it taste?
And was it all worth the wait?
So was it worth what it takes?

I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love

I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love
One more second's enough, second to love, second to love
I've been dying to love, dying to love, dying to love
One more second's enough, second to love, second to love
